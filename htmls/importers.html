<h1>OptiPloy's Importers</h1>
<h2>Importance</h2>
The first importer of OptiPloy, "STABLE," functioned by taking advantage of a built-in tool in Blender. This being the <code>override_hierarchy_create</code> function, which is used on collections for example. However, localizing the top collection caused the hierarchy to be disrupted, and would flood the
console with errors. Usually Blender would always compensate.<br><br>

The "FAST" importer was written to replicate the behavior of <code>override_hierarchy_create</code>, and yields no errors when localizing a collection, as there is no hierarchy to disrupt.<br><br>

"STABLE" is the most consistent, but can also be slower depending on the user hierarchy of the rig you may be importing. Hence why the other option is named "FAST."

<h2>Stable Importer</h2>
Relies on breaking the API by mis-using the <code>override_hierarchy_create</code> function. Based on how many data-blocks compose the rig, you will get more warnings in console, but Blender will compensate and you will usually get the most stable result.
<h2>Fast Importer</h2>
Takes a more robust approach by approximating the behavior of the <code>override_hierarchy_create</code>, and creates overrides in a specific order. This avoids warnings flooding the console. However, it has not been perfected and does not work with all rigs.
<h2>Do Your Own Trials</h2>
You can set a per-blend, per-folder, or global preference on the importer. See what works, see what doesn't.<br><br><br><br>
